> Most interesting things to me are `processes` - how world works, how governments are functioning, how business operates and makes profits, how people communicate. And to understand the process you need to threat it as a `mechanism` and disassemble it, like a wristwatch - for that you need both the trained vision and the right tools.  <br> <br>
> That's why I study `sociology` and work as a `data analyst` - I love understanding how things work and finding ways to make them work even better. Pairing theoretical sociology, research methods and project management with programming, statistics and visualisation helps me to do so most effectively both for the sake of the employer and my own vast interest in how things works.
